	  						<div class="concept-description">

	  						 HTML stands for Hypertext Marup Language. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks"

	  						 How the Web Works
	  						</div>

	  						<div class="concept-description">

	  						 The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the users computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the users screen.

	  						 Why Computers are Stupid
	  						</div>

	  						<div class="concept-description">

	  						 Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems.

	  						 Understanding Programming
	  						</div>

	  						<div class="concept-description">

	  						 The process of developing and implementing various sets of instructions to enable a computer to do a certain task. These instructions are considered computer programs and help the computer to operate smoothly. Programmers use programming language which is a formal constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.

	  						 Variables
	  						</div>

	  						<div class="concept-description">

	  						 Variable can vary so you can assign mutiple values to a variable when being used.  Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. You can assign different data types to variables such as  integers, decimals, or string characters in these variables.

	  						 Functions
	  						</div>

	  						<div class="concept-description">

	  						 A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.Python gives you many built-in functions like print() but you can also create your own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions that we can be writen and used to complete a specific task in your code making them very useful

	  						<div class="concept-description">

	  						A string is usually a bit of text you want to display to someone, or "export" out of the program you are writing. Python knows you want something to be a string when you put either (double-quotes) or (single-quotes) around the text.

	  						<div class="concept-description">

	  						 IF ELSE statement- If statment contains the block of code that executes if the conditional expression resolves to be True. If it is false then it  moves on to the optional statement else which runs block  code in the else statment.Note that it only runs once
